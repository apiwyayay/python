# Project Name

Classification Project using Python

## Project Description

This project is an implementation of classification using the Python programming language. The project aims to perform classification on a specific dataset using a chosen algorithm and can serve as a foundation for further classification projects.

## Features

- Dataset classification using a chosen algorithm.
- Evaluation of classification model performance.
- Integration with various well-known classification algorithms.

## User Guide

I'm using Visual Studio Code as my IDE in Windows 11.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIP (Python Package Manager)
